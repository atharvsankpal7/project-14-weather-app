# project-14-weather-app
This is my first project where I used A bootstrap and my own Css so this is kinda hybrid of them 
The responsive design was one of the most challanging task I ever faced so that I used my own CSS to make it responsive
It was fun making this glassomorphism design in an actual project 
The api used was `https://openweathermap.org`
The api returns the temperature in the kelvin unit so it has to be converted in celcius during runtime
